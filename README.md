## Architecture
The HomelyHub project using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack is designed to replicate the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. The architecture comprises a MongoDB database to store property and user data, while Express.js handles server-side logic and API endpoints. React is employed for building the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive experience for property listings and bookings. Node.js serves as the runtime environment for server-side execution, ensuring seamless communication between the front and back ends. The project follows a modular structure, with components for user authentication, property search, and booking features. Redux is integrated for efficient state management, enabling a smooth flow of data within the application. Additionally, the project employs RESTful API principles to facilitate communication between the client and server, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.
